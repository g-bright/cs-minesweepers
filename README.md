# cs-minesweepers
A console-based minesweeper game made purely to learn C#, still has a couple bugs and the code is untidy and poorly written.

This project has been made to help me learn C# concepts and also to get comfortable with using the C# syntax. Feel free to make any PRs if you see issues, however this is purely a learning project so don't expect top tier efficient code.

It will recieve updates only when I feel there is something reasonable that I could add/a C# concept I want to implement to further my learning and understanding. There also might be the odd bug fix here and there.
